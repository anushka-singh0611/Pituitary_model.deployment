## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an automated **Pituitary Tumor Segmentation** system using the **U-Net Deep Learning Architecture**.

The model takes MRI scans as input and predicts the tumor region by generating a segmentation mask.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end medical image segmentation pipeline including:

- Dataset Preprocessing
- Custom Dataset Creation
- DataLoader
- U-Net Architecture
- Model Training
- Model Deployment
- Prediction on Unseen MRI Images
